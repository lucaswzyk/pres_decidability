# Comments: 12th May 2020

## General remarks

	- you have no introduction on slides. You could add something as simple as asking
		yourself "can we mechanize mathematics?" (of course a bit more elaborate, but sparking
		from this question)

## Basics

	- "Basics", in a textbook, is used to refer to a collection of notions.
		In your presentation, you only have first-order logic in the basics.
	- Suggestion: changing "Basics" to "First-order logic"?
	- (very minor): slide 4 is for First-Order Logic syntax and 5 for semantics.
  - (fix) "Quantors" -> "Quantifiers"
  - Are you going to explain what a sentence and prenex normal form sentences are?
  - (suggestion) in slide 4 you have a good deal of free space.
		+ "senteces" are formulas where "every variable is quantified"
		+ in a sentence in "prenex normal form", all the quantifiers are "on the left" 
  - otherwise, slides 4 and 5 OK for now.
	- the content of Slide 6 if OK, perhaps think how you could better display the content.

## A Decidable Theory

  - slide 8: content OK, but the display can be improved.
	- slide 9: fantastic illustration.
		+ (suggestion) add some terminology, like states, transitions, final state.
		+ (clarify) in automata we do not have rejecting states! are q2 and q3
			drawn in that way to explain the reasoning behind a run of the automaton?
	- (typo) in slide 10 the example is over Sigma_3
	- (typo) should i in slide 11 be in {0,...,l}? otherwise, what is phi_0?
	- in slide 12, the "Important" sentence should IMO stand on top of the slide!
		+ first claim, then show why your claim holds.
	- could you move the last statement in slide 13 to slide 8, giving an idea of how
		the algorithm works?
	
## An Undecidable Theory
	- slide 15: similar to slide 8.
	- slide 16: good illustration, I would suggest adding a small flavor of terminology
		here as well.
	- slide 17: Undecidability of word problem for Turing machines is a big one!
		+ might deserve a citation?
	- slide 17: phi_M,w represents the computation history of M over w
		+ but it is important that phi_M,w is true iff M accepts w
		+ (suggestions) split that bullet?
	- slide 18: be sure to have a strong bridge here.
		Just looking to the slides gives the impression there is currently none.

- Please explain what objects you are operating on in the incompleteness section.
- Namely, how are proofs represented? What strings are the cited TMs consuming?
- point to the unprovable sentence, explain that it is the one you built in the proof.
