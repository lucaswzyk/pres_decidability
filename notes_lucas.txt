    - terminology (basically an automaton with an additional band for reading / writing)
    - record (old state, transition, new state) triples -> computation history
    
slide 18
    - theorem word problem and existence of mapping reduction need to be accepted
      but are not too hard to imagine
      
slide 19
    - sentences are either true or false, proof shows: there are some statements that are undecidable
    -> are these true or false?
    -> should we not be able to prove them?
    
slide 22
    - in our proof, this statement was rather 
      "This is a statement which you (dear Turing machine) cannot prove because it would break your logic."

maybe for discussion:
Riemann hypothesis: all zeros of Riemann zeta function are in {.5 + i a | a \in |R}
map problem to a sentence phi in Th(|N, +, x) and simultaneously try to proof both phi and \neg phi

suppose phi undecidable

suppose false, then provably false (find a zero off the line, construction / search)
-> decidable
-> it can't be false
-> it is true but unprovable

So proving that the Riemann hypothesis is undecidable would show that it must be true.
-> That would mean, one would prove it's true by showing it has no proof.
-> Contradiction? :p
